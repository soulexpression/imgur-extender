# Imgur Extender -  The semi-popular Chrome extension
Imgur Extender is a project by [@ZacMuerte](http://www.imgur.com/user/ZacMuerte) and (me) [@SoulExpression](http://imgur.com/user/SoulExpression), developed to change the loading icon and highlight the admins on http://imgur.com/.
I designed the extender to look near-identical to the settings page of Imgur.
